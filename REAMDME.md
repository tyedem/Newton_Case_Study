Newton.co (or known simply as Newton or Newton crypto) is a cryptocurrency trading platform founded in 2018 by entrepreneurs Dustin Walper, Erynn Saunders and Tyson Leslie after securing $15 million of funding by partnering with the North American based proprietary trading firm DV Trading [1,2]. Newton was founded in response to the major trends and innovations in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. All of which have occurred over the past 10 years starting with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009 and the rise of FinTech and the digitalization of financial products and services in the financial industry. In a 2018 Medium post, Walper notes that electronic payments have made financial transactions much more convenient, but that this has led to "90% of the value of all payments flow[ing] through an intermediary." Newton believes that cryptocurrency offers the opportunity to revolutionize the traditional financial system (TradFi) to be more inclusive and democratic. Cryptocurrency is a response to the centralization of inefficient TradFi systems, its infrastructure and a push for a more efficient, decentralized and accessible financial landscape. Newton was founded on the fact that crypto is difficult to acquire in Canada and places itself as a leader in the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange market [3].

Newton seeks to address the financial problem of high fees prevalent in the Canadian cryptocurrency market. Walper cites that there were deposit fees as high as 5% and trading fees of 0.75%. Newton acts as a market-maker to remove the fees typically found using an intermediary broker and by cultivating "top-tier banking relationships" so payment processing costs remain low. Newton publishes their buy and sell prices directly on their prices page, which gets updated every 10 seconds. Walper even strongly encourages other cryptocurrency platforms to follow his lead and list their spreads in order to show regulators that the industry is serious about fair and transparent markets [4*]. Newton has also registered with FINTRAC thus complying with anti-money laundering (AML) and combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations [5, 6].

Newton promotes its unfair advantage with low trading fees and zero funding or withdrawal fees. Additionally, they offer 47 different cryptocurrencies [7]; a much larger selection than any of its Canadian competitors, including Bitbuy [8], Coinberry [9], Coinsmart [10], NDAX.io [11], Netcoins [12] and Shakepay [13]. They also have a competitive edge over other international competitors such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin and Kraken, since not all of these exchanges necessarily support CAD in all their services [14]. Thus, Newton positions itself as a strong and favorable choice for Canadian consumers evidenced by announcing that they have reached their 200,000th customer this past May 2021 [15].

According to Netcents 2019 research, 15% of Canadians own or have purchased cryptocurrencies. This statistic doubles to 30% when filtered for Millennials [16]. With the Canadian population hovering around 37.5 million [17], this means there are about 5.5 million Canadians who have invested into crypto.

Cryptocurrency exchanges have a number of core metrics to measure their success such as lifetime value (LTV), uniqueness, trading volume (TV), market pairs (MP), cost per click (CPC), cost per registration (CPR), conversion rate (CR), average order volume (AOV), median order volume (MOV), market making liquidity (MML), market taker liquidity (MTL) and daily active users (DAU) [18]. However, these core metrics are not publicly available for Newton.

However, Google Trends and Alexa analytics can be used to measure Newton's website performance compared to its competitors. In Google Trends, Newton scores an average 'Interest over time' score of 30. Ahead of competitors Bitbuy (score of 14), Coinberry (7), Shakepay (20) and Ndax.io (23). Interest over time represents search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is peak popularity, while 50 means it is only half popular [19].

For Alexa, Newton.co scores 36.5% in its percentage of overall organic site traffic. Compared with coinberry.com (27.3%), butbuy.ca (22.7%), ndax.io (17.3%) and netcoins.ca (9.3%). However, it falls short in its ranking of referral sites driving traffic to their website with a score of 76. Compared with bitbuy.ca (172), coinberry.com (150), netcoins.ca (103) and ndax.io (85) [20]. From these basic search and traffic analytics, Newton performs well against its competitors organically, but it could improve its funnelling strategies to help drive more traffic to their website.

Granted Newton’s emphasis is on simplicity obvious through their sleek, simple and easy-to-use website and mobile app, they would stand to benefit from including technical indicators to their financial charts [21] such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Bollinger Bands (BB), Volume (V) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Newton could look to Binance [22] to see how they have incorporated their indicators into their technical charts. The benefit of including technical indicators would be to attract more experienced traders who would otherwise use other exchanges or charting websites like TradingView [23] that offer technical indicators for their financial analysis. Better trading tools should yield greater TV, AOV, MOV and DAU. To build these technical indicators Newton would need to import the Python library talib for calculating the technical indicators and the libraries matplotlib and mplfinance for plotting them [24]. Keeping a ‘Basic’ chart view for the less adept traders, while having an ‘Advanced’ chart view for more seasoned technical traders would better cater to their customers’ needs. An ‘Advanced’ view may even intrigue the novice to learn more about technical analysis and refine their skills as traders. By providing customers the tools and support they need to succeed, can only lead to greater customer retention and ultimately a strong return on investment.
